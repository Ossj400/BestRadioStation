# BestRadioStation
Choose your favorite radio (WPF app - scraping from html page) - here I trie to practise good, solid practices.

I needed to practise my C# skills, use some good practices and wished to try design pattern (but project is too small for practical use of these, I think).
How it works? 
  In practise it's internet radio receiver, you can choose genre of music then choose radiostation from list, add radiostations to your favorite list of radios, add songs names from radio to your list of songs (maybe later you will listen it from yt or buy a CD, go to concert ;))
  From the other side, the radio is written in C# using WPF .Net Core with NuGet AgilityHTMLPack. AgilityHTML.. is used to scrap data (like radio name, url, song name) from website (where is a lot of radios!). Scraped data is used in program. Favorite lists (radio/songs) are saved in txt file.
