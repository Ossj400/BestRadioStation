# BestRadioStation
I needed to practise my C# skills, some good practices and was wishing to try design pattern but project is too small for this, I think.
How it works? 
  In practise it's internet radio, you can choose genre of music, then play radio, add radio to your favorite list of radios, add song from radio to your list of songs (maybe later you will listen it from yt or buy a CD, go to concert ;))
  From other way, the radio is written in C# using WPF .Net Core with AgilityHTMLPack. AgilityHTML is used to scrapp data (like radio name, url, song name) from site where is  a lot of radios. Data is used in program and favorite lists are saved in txt file.
Choose your favorite radio (WPF app - scrapping from html page) - practising good practices
